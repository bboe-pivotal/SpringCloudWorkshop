== Schedule

This is a _loose_ schedule for the day. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material.

The lectures for this class are intentionally very light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly!


Start by downloading the course materials into a working directory for the day.  This can be accomplished either through the GitHub website and downloading a zip, or if you have Git installed, use the following commands:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/cdelashmutt-pivotal/SpringCloudWorkshop
$ cd SpringCloudWorkshop/
$ git fetch --all
----
