= Lab 5 - Deploy a .NET Application

In this lab we'll deploy an ASP.NET v5 application to Cloud Foundry, and run it inside of a linux container using the .NET CoreCLR. 

NOTE: ASP.NET 5 is not yet GA, and so many of you may not have it installed already.  There are instructions included below on installing ASP.NET 5, or you can choose to use the completed materials available at `$COURSE_HOME/session_03/dotnet/lab_05/complete`.
