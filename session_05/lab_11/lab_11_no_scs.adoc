= Lab 11 - Circuit Breakers

[abstract]
Cloud-native architectures are typically composed of multiple layers of distributed services. End-user requests may comprise multiple calls to these services, and if a lower-level service fails, the failure can cascade up to the end user and spread to other dependent services. Heavy traffic to a failing service can also make it difficult to repair. Using Circuit Breakers, along with the Cloud Foundry Circuit Breaker Dashboard, you can prevent failures from cascading and provide fallback behavior until a failing service is restored to normal operation.

== Building and Pushing the Hystrix Dashboard

. First, build hello-hystrix-dashboard app.

. Now let's enable the Circuit Breaker pattern for our UI service.  We want to use a circuit breaker to provide a barrier around failures within the Hello Service.
Start by going to the hello-ui project, and editing the `io.pivotal.helloui.HelloUiApplication` class.  Add the `@EnableCircuitBreaker` annotation.
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.helloui;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker;  // <--- Add this import
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableCircuitBreaker  // <--- Add this annotation
public class HelloUiApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloUiApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----
+
. Next, let's add a fallback method that surrounds our Hello Service dependency.  Go into `io.pivotal.helloui.controller.SayHelloCommand` and add the `@HystrixCommand` annotation, along with an appropriate fallback method, as shown below.
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.helloui.controller;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalanced;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

import com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.annotation.HystrixCommand;  // <--- Add this

@Component
public class SayHelloCommand {

	@Autowired
	@LoadBalanced
	RestTemplate restTemplate;

	 @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "sayHelloFallback")   // <--- Add this
    public String sayHello(String toWho) throws Exception {
        try{
        	return restTemplate.getForObject("http://hello-world-server/hello?name={name}", String.class, toWho);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw e;
        }
    }

	public String sayHelloFallback(String toWho) {   // --- Add this method ---
		return String.format("Come back later to hear me say hello, %s", toWho);
	}
}
----

== Build and Push the applications

. Change to the directory that contains hello-ui and hello-server components.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/initial
----
+
.  Build the applications
+
----
$ gradlew.bat assemble
----
+
.  Push the applications and tell Cloud Foundry not to start the applications.
+
----
$cf push
----

== Use the Circuit Breaker Dashboard

. Open the Application Manager console in your browser.  Go to the org and space where you created the service instances and scroll down until you see the entry for the hystrix-dashboard app.
+
image::../../Common/images/lab11_no_scs_screenshot1.png[]
+
. Click the url link under the hystrix-dashboard app. 

. In the starting page, enter the url for your hello-ui application, using the http scheme, and the hystrix.stream resource like the example below:
+
image::../../Common/images/lab11_no_scs_screenshot2.png[]

. In another browser tab or window, open the Hello-UI app and add some text in the textbox.  You should see the execution counts change in the hystrix-dashboard app.
+
image::../../Common/images/lab11_no_scs_screenshot3.png[]

== Bonus
. Go to the Application Manager console and stop the Hello Server.

. Go to the Hello UI and enter some text for the Hello World Service.

. The Circuit Breaker Dashboard should show the Circuit Breaker has changed to "Open" and the error count is increasing.

. Start the Hello Server back up again.

. Go back to the Hello UI and see the service eventually comes back up again.
