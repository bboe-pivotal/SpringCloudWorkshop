= Lab 8 - Binding to Spring Cloud Services

[abstract]
In this lab, we'll deploy a couple of really simple microservices. The first is a RESTful API that has the business logic needed to say Hello to people. The second is a UI that finds out who you are and then says Hello to you.

== Creating Service Instances for Hello World Spring Cloud Services Demo Application

. Create the services the demo application depends on, first start with an instance of the config service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server -c '{"git": { "uri": "https://github.com/bboe-pivotal/hello-world-config-repo" } }'
Creating service instance config-server in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. Now, we need an instance of the service registry service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry
Creating service instance service-registry in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. The final service that we need is for the circuit breaker dashboard.
+
----
$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. The services may take a few minutes to initialize. Use the cf services command to see the status on creating these services and wait until they all have status "create succeeded"
+
----
$cf services
Getting services in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK

name               service                       plan       bound apps   last operation
circuit-breaker    p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   standard                create succeeded
config-server      p-config-server               standard                create in progress
service-registry   p-service-registry            standard                create succeeded
----

== Build and Push the applications

. Change to the directory that contains hello-ui and hello-server components.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/initial/hello-world
----

. Open the manifest.yml file.  Notice the application names and the service bindings.
+
----
---
memory: 1GB
instances: 1
applications:
- name: hello-server
  host: hello-server-${random-word}
  path: hello-server/target/hello-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - service-registry
  - config-server
- name: hello-ui
  host: hello-ui-${random-word}
  path: hello-ui/target/hello-ui-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - service-registry
  - config-server
  - circuit-breaker
----

.  Build the applications
+
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
or
C:\>gradlew.bat assemble
----
.  Push the applications and tell Cloud Foundry not to start the applications quite yet
+
----
$cf push --no-start

.  Spring Cloud Services uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication. If your Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation is using a self-signed SSL certificate, the certificate will need to be added to the JVM truststore before your client application can use a Service Registry service instance to discover a service application. Start by taking note of the Cloud Foundry API endpoint of your environment.
+
----
$cf api
API endpoint: https://api.mypcfdeployemnt.mycompany.com (API version: 2.43.0)
----

. Enable Spring Cloud Services to add the certificate automatically by setting the TRUST_CERTS environment variable on the hello-server and hello-ui applications to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance. First do this for the hello-server application.
+
----
$cf set-env hello-server TRUST_CERTS api.mypcfdeployemnt.mycompany.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.mypcfdeployemnt.mycompany.com' for app hello-server in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Then repeat for the hello-ui application
+
----
$cf set-env hello-ui TRUST_CERTS api.mypcfdeployemnt.mycompany.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.mypcfdeployemnt.mycompany.com' for app hello-ui in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Now the applications are ready to run. First start the hello-server application.
+
----
$cf start hello-server
