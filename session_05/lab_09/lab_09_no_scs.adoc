= Lab 9 - Exploring the Service Registry

[abstract]
The service registry is a phone book for your microservices. Each service registers itself with the service registry and tells the registry where it lives (host, port, node name) and perhaps other service-specific metadata - things that other services can use to make informed decisions about it.  In this lab, we'll use the Service Registry to bind our two lonely microservices together.

== Building and Pushing the Service Registry

. First, build hello-eureka app.

. Now we need to push the hello-eureka app to Cloud Foundry

. Notice in your output of the push of the service registry, it was bound to a random host name to prevent collisions between students.  We need to now create a user provided service for the Eureka service registry.
+
. Note the random host name and use the text below as a guide.  You will need to modify the uri component to match your service registry app url.
+
----
$ cf cups service-registry -p "uri

uri> http://<PUT THE HOSTNAME FOR YOUR SERVICE REGISTRY HERE>
Creating user provided service service-registry in org cdelashmutt-org / space development as cdelashmutt@pivotal.io...
OK

$
----
+
. Next, we need to tell Cloud Foundry to bind this service instance to each of our applications.  Open the manifest.yml file and add two `services` sections, one for each application, that references the new service you created.
+
----
---
memory: 1GB
instances: 1
applications:
- name: hello-server
  host: hello-server-${random-word}
  path: hello-server/build/libs/hello-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:                #  Add this section
  - service-registry
- name: hello-ui
  host: hello-ui-${random-word}
  path: hello-ui/build/libs/hello-ui-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:                #  And add this one
  - service-registry
----
+
. Next, inside of the `hello-server` project, edit the io.pivotal.HelloServerApplication class.  Add the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation, and its import.
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;  // <--- Add this

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient  // <---- Add this
public class HelloServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----
+
. Repeat this change for the `hello-ui` project, editing the io.pivotal.helloui.HelloUiApplication class
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.helloui;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;  // <--- Add this

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient  // <--- Add this
public class HelloUiApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloUiApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----
. Now, you can easily talk to the hello-server from the hello-ui using logical bindings.  Let's try it.  In the hello-ui project, open up `io.pivotal.helloui.controller.SayHelloCommand` and refactor it to look like this:
+
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.helloui.controller;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;  // <--- Add this
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalanced; // <--- Add this
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;  // <--- Add this

@Component
public class SayHelloCommand {

	@Autowired                      //
	@LoadBalanced                   //   <--- Add these lines
	RestTemplate rt;                //

    public String sayHello(String toWho) throws Exception {
        try{
        	return rt.getForObject("https://hello-world-server/hello?name={name}", String.class, toWho);  // <--- Change this
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
----
+
Notice a couple of things here.  First, we can access the hello-world-server using a logical name instead of
a true DNS'able host.  This means that as this thing moves around, or as this service is deployed into different
environments, we stay agnostic to its location, and thereby resilient to change.
+
Notice also the `@LoadBalanced` annotation on our `restTemplate.` This means that Spring Cloud Services will automatically
load balance across multiple instances of the hello-world-server service.
+
Oh yeah, and remember back when we gave each of these microservices a name inside of bootstrap.yml?  That's how that
microservice gets registered into the Service Registry, and this becomes the logical name that dependencies use to
interact with it.

== Build and Push the applications

. Make sure everything is saved and then change to the directory that contains hello-ui and hello-server components.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/initial
----
. Update the hello-ui and hello-server src/main/resources/application.properties files and add the following line
+
----
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=${vcap.services.service-registry.credentials.uri:http://127.0.0.1:8761}/eureka/
----
+
.  Build the applications
+
----
$ gradlew.bat assemble
----
+
.  Push the applications to Cloud Foundry.
+
----
$cf push
----
+
. Verify that the applications started by visiting the URL for the hello-ui application and testing it out.
+

. Now, let's take a quick look inside the Service Registry.  Open the Application Manager console in your browser.  Go to the org and space where you deployed the service registry app, and scroll down until you see the entry for the hello-eureka app.
. Click the on the URL bound to the application to bring up the service registry dashboard. Notice that both the server and UI apps have registered themselves. Explore the dashboard.
