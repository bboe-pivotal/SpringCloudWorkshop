= Alternate Lab 7 - Setting up Continuous Integration with Cloud Foundry

[abstract]
--
In this lab we will demonstrate a _very_ simple CI flow.  Normally, a full CI pipeline would consist of multiple steps, integrate with an artifact repository, create short-lived spaces within Cloud Foundry to run integration tests, etc.  Here, we will simply pull code from Github and push it to Cloud Foundry in a very simple blue-green manner using PCF route mapping.

== Configure your build system

. We will be using the same .NET code from the .NET portion of session 3.  Don't worry if you didn't do this lab, or if you don't know anything about .NET, the completed code is checked in to the https://github.com/jrolfe-pivotal/ColorService GitHub repository for use throughout the rest of this lab.

. If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one.  Once you are logged into GitHub, fork this repository to your account:  https://github.com/jrolfe-pivotal/ColorService.  (If you've never used GitHub before, grab an instructor, and they can show you how to perform a fork).

Note: If you do not have a GitHub repository, and do not wish to create an account, you may use the root repository.  You will not, however, be able to commit changes, and will have to ask one of the instructors to make a commit for you when you're ready to test the CI flow.

. We'll be using a PCF managed deployment of Jenkins, which means that user identity is integrated between the two, and you can log into Jenkins using the same credentials you've been using all day with Cloud Foundry.  Open https://jenkins-0.pcf14.cloud.fe.pivotal.io (replacing pcf14 with the environment you've been using today if necessary) in a browser and login.

. You'll see a folder with your username on it, e.g. _student40_.  Click on this folder, and then select _New Item_ from the left hand side menu bar.  

. Create a new _Freestyle project_ called `color-service-build` and then click OK.

. Scroll down to the section labeled _Source Code Management_.  Choose `Git`, and enter the GitHub URL that points to the fork you created earlier.
